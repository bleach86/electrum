# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report security issues send an email to core@particl.io.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name | Fingerprint |
|------|-------------|
| Particl Core (shared key) | 0F7C 8778 254F 2E28 2644  2BAC 52D9 8BD1 59DF AF40 |

You can import a key by running the following command with that
individual’s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"`
Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints containing spaces.

These public keys can also be found in the Electrum git repository,
in the top-level `pubkeys` folder.
